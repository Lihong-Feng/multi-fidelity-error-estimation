# multi-fidelity-error-estimation for large-scale time-delay systems. The scripts are run by the file: run_all_coplanar.m. The error of the reduced order models constructed by different greedy algorithms are computed and compared with the FOM by the script: validate_error_coplanar.m. The code implements the algorithms proposed in the work: Lihong Feng, Luigi Lombardi, Giulio Antonini, Peter Benner. Multi-fidelity error estimation accelerates greedy model reduction of complex dynamical systems. https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05610. The second model in the paper is used as an example to implement the algorithms.
